Structures in C are user-defined data types that allow you to combine different data types under a single name.
They are used to group related data items of different data types.

struct struct_name {
    // Member variables
    data_type1 member1;
    data_type2 member2;
    // ...
    data_typen membern;
};

Declaring structure variables:
Using structure tag:
struct Person {
    char name[50];
    int age;
};

int main() {
    struct Person person1;
    struct Person person2;
}
With structure declaration:
struct student
{
    char name[20];
    int roll_no;
}stu1,stu2;
