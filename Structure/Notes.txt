Structures in C are user-defined data types that allow you to combine different data types under a single name.
They are used to group related data items of different data types.

struct struct_name {
    // Member variables
    data_type1 member1;
    data_type2 member2;
    // ...
    data_typen membern;
};

Declaring structure variables:
Using structure tag:
struct Person {
    char name[50];
    int age;
};

int main() {
    struct Person person1;
    struct Person person2;
}
With structure declaration:
struct student
{
    char name[20];
    int roll_no;
}stu1,stu2;

For efficiency the compiler generates instructions to store variables on their natural size bound addresses in the memory.
This is also true for structures.Member elements of a sturcture are located on their natural size boundary. 

char
address 0403010 0403011 0403012 0403013 0403014 0403015

short  
address 0403010 0403012 0403014 0403016 0403018 040301A

int
address 0403010 0403014 0403018 040301C 0403020 0403024 

typedef is used to give an alias name to primitive and user defined data type.
